                    College of Art and Design (which were, before April 1989, run by Devon County Council) and Seale-Hayne 
                    College (which before April 1989 was an independent charity). It was renamed Polytechnic South West in 
                    1989,a move that was unpopular with students as the name lacked identity. It was the only polytechnic to 
                    be renamed and remained as "PSW" until gaining university status in 1992 along with the other 
                    polytechnics. The new university absorbed the Plymouth School of Maritime Studies.
