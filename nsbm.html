        <p style = "color:black;">The student selection and the admission procedure of NSBM Green University is carried out independently by the university itself. NSBM offers two intakes annually.[24] The 1st intake usually starts in March, whereas the 2nd intake begins in October each year. The students need to apply directly to the university.[25]<br><br> The student selection is carried out based on the student admission policy of NSBM, considering the standard examination results and institutional requirements.

            NSBM also offers admission to the students applied under the Interest Free Student Loan Scheme introduced by the State Ministry of Higher Education[26] in which the ministry manages the application and registration process.</p><hr>
        <h3><font color = "black" style = "Times New Roman"><u>History of NSBM Green University</h3></font></u>
        <p style = "color:black;">National School of Business Management was founded in 2011 as the degree awarding university under the National Institute of Business Management to award undergraduate and post-graduate degrees.[10][11]<br><br> Followed by a series of government protocols, the approval was granted to set up a higher education institute named National School of Business Management (NSBM). It was registered as a limited company under the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007.[12] The first Board of Directors of the company was appointed in July 2011, consisting of 5 members.[13]<br><br> In the wake of the discussions about the location of the proposed institute, a land of 26 acres in Pitipana, Homagama was selected and later obtained in December 2011.[14] The NSBM Green University Town project's construction work officially began at an investment of 10.2 billion LKR[15] in 2013, after clearing government sanctions and approvals.[13] While the construction was underway, NSBM commenced its operations as a city campus.[13]

            NSBM city campus was launched in Nugegoda with a modest organizational structure consisting of School of Business, School of Computing, Finance Division, and Administration Division.[13] On 25th February 2012, it officially began the education delivery process inaugurating the first set of students for the University College Dublin and the UGC approved degree programs.[13] Later the same year, the city campus expanded its presence with the addition of three new buildings in close proximity to the main building.<br><br> Over the period of the next four years since its inception, the city campus continued till it was moved to NSBM Green University Town premises. Along the way, more undergraduate and postgraduate degrees programs and new academic partnerships were added to the NSBM profile.[13] These comprise the Management, Computing, Engineering, and Design degrees offered by NSBM or affiliated with Plymouth University, UK, Victoria University, Australia and Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, Malaysia.[16][17]<br><br>
            
            The construction of the NSBM Green University Town was carried out by MAGA Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd[18] together with the design and consultation of Engineering Consultancy (Pvt.) Ltd.[19] On 26th October 2016, the newly constructed university complex was ceremonially declared open, concluding a construction project spanned over two years and ten months.[20]</p><hr>
